So for this thing to work you need to install pillow for python 3. any flavor
of python 3 should work. Ensure you dont have PIL installed (you should know already
if you do). This program only runs on .dmi files so it should be safe to run it anywhere.
If you feel like changing how the sort works, change the function atoz(key) knowing that
key is a list in the form:
["icon name", directions, frames, "extra data as a string",[list of icons]]
directions*frames is the number of icons.
I tried to make this modular, so feel free to rip it apart and use bits of it.
Try to give me credit where credit is due though :P
Also you should REALLY think about resaving the file after you use this program on it.
When run from the cmd line it prints out every file that it touches, if a file is on that list
it needs to be resaved so that the metadata is what byond expects. Now I know that it will run
without resaving (byond's current version doesn't seem to care) but future versions may not.
And for small files the file is usually bigger (especially paletted pngs, since they have a bug
in the Pillow library afaik, or I'm incapable of the mental gymnastics to fix it) before you resave.
also paths like ..\..\icons should work fine when used with the recurser
