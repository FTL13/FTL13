 	info = "We've discovered something floating in space. We can't really tell how old it is, but it is scraped and bent to hell. There object is the size of about a room with double doors that we have yet to break into.   It is a lot sturdier than we could have imagined.  We have decided to call it 'The Vault' "

 	info = "The syndicate have invaded.  Their ships appeared out of nowhere and now they likely intend to kill us all and take everything.  On the off-chance that the Vault may grant us sanctuary, many of us have decided to force our way inside and bolt the door, taking as many provisions with us as we can carry.  In case you find this, send for help immediately and open the Vault. Find us inside."
