/*
Fusion engine upgrade system

This file contains all the different possible mods and fuels for the various parts of the POMF fusion engine.

When applied to an engine part, the engine calls on the mod's get_effects() proc in order to determine what happens.
A return value of 0 means the mod cannot be applied.
A return value of 1 means the proc was successful.
A return value of 2 means the mod needs to wait for another mod to initialize first.

Rarity decides the worth of the mod and where it can be found
Rarity -1 is admin spawn only
Rarity 0 can be found for sale at the first station
Rarity 1 can be found for sale in friendly space every round
Rarity 2 can very rarely be found for sale in friendly space or more commonly in unfriendly space
Rarity 3 can be found very rarely for sale in unfriendly space or found as salvage/boarding loot
Rarity 4 can only be found from high tier salvage or boarding
Rarity 5 is only found from special events or planet exploration

Eventualy mods will be applied in a more complex (in-game) procedure but it's like this for now for testing purposes.
