/*
With this module in place, you should ideally NEVER modify the value of `world.maxz`
directly during runtime. Instead, you can use these functions to replicate its functionality,
while having the convenience of managed transitions, level attributes, and arbitrary
amounts of level creation.
Modify this if you want to add features to this.

INTERFACE: Objects and Functions that you should call from outside of this module:

space_manager:
  `initialize()`: Sets up a z level handler for all existing z levels - `map_transition_config` must be
  set before this is called, and that's defined in the appropriate map includer file. This should be called
  BEFORE any other method of this object, but AFTER your first set of z levels are created.

  `get_zlev(zpos)`: Returns the `space_level` datum corresponding to the z level
  you provide this function. Will complain if that z position is unmanaged. This function
  in particular is the reason why managing levels with this system is important.

  `get_zlev_by_name(name)`: Returns the `space_level` datum that has the name you
  provide here. Will complain if there's no level named that.

  `rename_level(zpos, new_name)`: Changes the name of the level at position `zpos`
  to `new_name`.

  `add_trait(zpos, trait)`: Adds the trait `trait` to the level at position `zpos`'s
  flags.

  `remove_trait(zpos, trait)`: Removes the trait `trait` from the level at position `zpos`'s
  flags.

  `is_zlevel_dirty(zpos)`: Checks if the given z level has an init freeze placed on it or not.
  Important when loading maps, where not everything is in place before `initialize` is called.
  Should only be used in determining whether an atom should init or not.

  `postpone_init(zpos, thing)`: Adds `thing` to a list of things on level `zpos` to
  initialize later. To be called in code that will initialize objects.

  `add_dirt(zpos)`: Adds a counter to a level that should prevent initialization from happening
  on it. Referenced in the `is_zlevel_dirty` used above. Use this when you're loading a map
  and don't want things to try to initialize while your map is half-loaded (prevents a LOT of
  nasty atmos runtimes).

  `remove_dirt(zpos)`: Decrements the counter on the given level - when this reaches 0, initialization
  will resume, and all objects that were frozen in init will be initialized.

  `increase_max_zlevel_to(new_maxz)`: Repeatedly increases the maximum z level. These levels will all
  be `SELFLOOPING` and block teleports, while also having a generic name. You can modify these levels
  later, if you want.

  `add_new_zlevel(name, linkage = SELFLOOPING, traits = list(BLOCK_TELEPORT))`:
  Creates a new z level at the top of the map with the given linkage and attributes.
  Doesn't actually do linking for that level, though - you'll need to call
  `setup_space_destinations` for that.

    Returns the z position of the newly-created level.

  `route_linkage()`:
    Creates a new set of transitions for all CROSSLINKED levels. This will
    scramble the connections for existing CROSSLINKED levels. You'll need to call
    `setup_space_destinations` when you are done. This must be called before
    `setup_space_destinations` is called, and is integral for space transitions to work.

  `setup_space_destinations(force_all_rebuilds = 0)`:
    Makes all z levels with changed transition types re-set the destinations of all
    their space tiles. If you call this with `force_all_rebuilds` set to 1, then
    ALL levels will have their space turfs' destinations set instead.

  `do_transition_setup()`:
    Calls `route_linkage()` and `setup_space_destinations(1)` in order. A convenient
    wrapper.

space_level:
  `add_to_transit(turf/open/space/S)`:
    Adds the given turf to the appropriate transition list for this level. Used in `AfterChange`
    of space turfs.

  `remove_from_transit(turf/open/space/S)`:
    Removes the given turf from the appropriate transition list for this level. Used in `BeforeChange`
    to prevent making turfs on the edge of the world causing a runtime.

  `apply_transition(turf/open/space/S)`:
    Sets the turf's transition data. Used for making new space turfs on the edge of the map
    have the right transition data.

  `get_turfs()`:
    Returns a list of all turfs on this z level, similar to using `Block`.

  `set_linkage(transition_type)`:
    `transition_type` can be one of 3 types:
      UNAFFECTED: You can bump into the border of the level, and not go anywhere
      SELFLOOPING: Going off one side of the level sends you back on the other
      CROSSLINKED: This level is added to the main space network, reachable
      from the main station (usually)
    After this is called, you must call `space_manager.setup_space_destinations()`
    to make the level actually have destinations set up.

  `add_to_space_network(datum/spacewalk_grid/SW)`:
    Adds the given level to the space network SW. Used for CROSSLINKED levels.

  `remove_from_space_network(datum/spacewalk_grid/SW)`:
    Removes the given level from the space network SW. Not entirely stable - can
    result in some levels being isolated from others. Could be used for a system
    that had multiple space networks, in the future.

Other:
`is_level_<trait>`(z): A set of procs that check if the level has the given trait.
  Look in `level_traits` for more info

`is_on_level_name(atom/A, zname)`: Checks if the given atom is on the level entitled "zname"

`atoms_share_level(atom/A, atom/B)`: Returns true if the two atoms share a level.
  Can be useful for future expansion, but right now it's super simple.
