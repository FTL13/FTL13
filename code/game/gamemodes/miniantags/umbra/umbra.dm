Umbras are residual entities created by the dying who possess enough anger or determination that they never fully pass on.
Physically, they're incorporeal and invisible. Umbras are formed of a steadily-decaying electromagnetic field with a drive to sustain itself.
Umbras do this by feeding on a substance, found in the dead or dying, known as vitae.

Vitae is most closely comparable to adrenaline in that is produced by creatures at times of distress. For this reason, almost all dead creatures have vitae in one way or another.
Biologically, it's indistinguishable from normal blood, but vitae is what allows creatures to survive grievous wounds or cling to life in critical condition. It provides a large amount of energy.
It's for this reason that umbras desire it. Vitae serves as a potent energy source to a living thing, and umbras can use the energy of this vitae to sustain themselves.
Without enough vitae, the field that sustains an umbra will break down and weaken. If the umbra has no vitae at all, it will permanently dissipate.

Umbras are not without their weaknesses. Despite being invisible to the naked eye and untouchable, certain things can restrict, weaken, or outright harm them.
Piles of salt on the ground will prevent an umbra's passage, making areas encircled in it completely inaccessible to even the most determined umbra.
In addition, objects and artifacts of a holy nature can force an umbra to manifest or draw away some of the energy that it's gleaned through vitae.

When an umbra dies, two things can occur. If the umbra died from passive vitae drain, it will be dead forever, with no way to bring it back.
However, if the umbra is slain forcibly and still has vitae, the vitae possesses enough power to coalesce a part of the umbra into umbral ashes.
These "ashes" will, given around a full minute, re-form into another umbra. This umbra typically possesses the memories and consciousness of the old one, but may be a completely new mind as well.
Although these umbral ashes make umbras resilient, they can be killed permanently by scattering the ashes or destroying them, thus separating the vitae from the umbra's remains.

	from them. At first the idea sounds horrible - stealing their very life force - but as you continue to weaken it sounds more and more appealing... you think it'd be as simple as interacting \
	with them. Something in the back of your mind tells you to call this life force <i>vitae</i>.\n\
